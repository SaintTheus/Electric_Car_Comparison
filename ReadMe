Compared an electric car currently under development against its expected
rival, the Tesla Model S. 


What code accomplished below:
-Used data to help compute the power required for the Tesla and for the
development car as they both go around the track
-Plotted the racetrack using coordinates given along with the maximum power of each vehicle on three points on the track(Matplotlib)
-Created a concise and neat table which reports the maximum power required for each of the three given
scenarios(Development car on a flat track and real track / Tesla on a real track)
-create a bar chart that compares the development car's power requirements against the Teslas -Calculate how many kilograms must be reduced so that the maximum power required by the development car is 1%
less than the Teslas maximum power requirement
-With the new mass, I redid all of the prior graphs comparing the power of the Tesla with the new development car after reducing the mass
-I finally plotted a graph to compare the old and new development car
